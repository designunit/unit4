# ABOUT US

Studio design unit 4 was created in 2016.

Concept of a studio is built bearing in mind specifics of creative business and
using tools for supporting and testing design solutions that are currently on the
forefront of the industry. We know how to optimize the design process and
allocate right amount of time, resources, and efforts for each stage to reach best
quality of a concept, its solutions, and its implementation in materials.

For each project, we supervise providers to control realization of conceptual
solutions at manufacturing and building site.

We know the power of design and share it profusely.
